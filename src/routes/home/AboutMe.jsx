              My story in frontend development starts in 2021, when I started
              studying HTML, CSS and Javascript. And ever since, I've been
              creating projects for practicing my skills and learning new stacks
              like React, TailwindCSS. <br /> Iâ€™m a blend of introvert and
              extrovert, with a passion for playing guitar, samba, travel and
              immersing myself in diverse cultures. Friends often describe me as
              charismatic, energetic, and full of cheer. Whether it's through
              code or conversation, I love connecting with new people and
              sharing my enthusiasm for life.
